# Mediator Pattern

Few examples of Mediator pattern include 

1.) Air traffic control - All planes interact with the central controller. 
They don't interact with every other plane nearby them before landing but The central controller
manages everything between them.

2.) Traffic police standing on a junction of 4 sides. 
There everything is managed by the police officer acting as mediator.
