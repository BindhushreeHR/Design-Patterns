# Facade Pattern

``` 
It provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. 
It defines a higher level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
```

- This pattern is very much similar to Adapter pattern but the difference to note is the intent.

- The Intent of this pattern is to simplify a system for client. 

- For eg let's say we install a Home theater in our home. It has close to 10 subsystems eg cdPlayer, dvdPlayer, lights(we want to dim),
amplifier, projector, a popcorn popper as well.

- So now when I want to watch a movie I want to on these all in particular order and when I want to switch them off then we need to switch off all of them.

- This is very hectic and probably we'll start thinking to watch in phone. Huh bad

- Here comes Facade pattern. It helps us to simplify a complex set of subsystems by providing a simpler interface to client.

- The difference of Facade and Adapter is mostly of Intent.
