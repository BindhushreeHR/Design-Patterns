# Iterator Pattern

``` 
It provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate without exposing its underlying representation. 
```

- The main idea of this pattern is to extract traversal behaviour of a collection/aggregate object into a separate object.

- This will allow multiple iterators to work simultaneously on the collection/aggregate object.
