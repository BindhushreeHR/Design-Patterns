# Memento Pattern

An example for this pattern can be a text file 
- Here we are adding data. But there are options for saving the text and undo as well.
- Saving state saves the current snapshot of system. 
- In this pattern rather than storing all data at a common place we save state in the object itself.
- Otherwise if we want to save at a common place then situation can occur that a particular piece of data might not be accessible
